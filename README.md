# Dynamic Memory Manager Project

For this project I implemented a basic heap manager for my Operating Systems class. The standard C runtime library provides a standard heap manager through the malloc and free library calls. For this project I implemented my own version of this interface.

The dmalloc and dfree APIs were implemented by myself in the dmm.h and dmm.c files.

I conducted testing and debugging using the test files provided by Prof. Danyang Zhuo using the GDB debug tool.
